### Hi there, I'm Kevin Sy!

I'm someone who was inspired by my friends to join the road of becoming a master developer! 

I've always been interested in coding, but the fear of learning something completely new was the wall that stopped me from taking the first step. However, here I am now, looking for an error at line 256 when my code only goes up to line 75. ðŸ« 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge and skills in Javascript and Python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kevsy.97@gmail.com
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Boba, Anime and Kdrama
