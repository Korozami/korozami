### Hi there, I'm Kevin Sy!

I'm someone who was inspired by my friends to join the road of becoming a master developer! 

I've always been interested in coding, but the fear of learning something completely new was the wall that stopped me from taking the first step. However, here I am now, looking for an error at line 256 when my code only goes up to line 75. 🫠

Currently comfortable with Javascript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Express, Node.
